Hello. This is a GitHub for all of my projects in one place. I had a school GitHub for various projects, but I don't want it all to be lost when my Quincy email gets deleted.

This does not include any graphic design projects.

School Projects on other GitHubs
- https://github.com/PiersonCourtois/CapstoneProject2023 - this is my senior computer science capstone project. It is intended to be a program used by earthquake and other natural disaster response teams to find survivors faster than human teams can. I worked with 2 other people in this project. I mostly worked on UI stuff. Currently this is private, but I have contacted the person who owns it to make it public. Sorry for any inconvience.
