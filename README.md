Hello. This is a GitHub for all of my projects in one place. I had a school GitHub for various projects, but I don't want it all to be lost when my Quincy email gets deleted.

This does not include any graphic design projects.

I have uploaded videos of some of my projects to youtube @ https://www.youtube.com/@MaryHoette?app=desktop
I plan to upload more videos as I put everything on here.

Current Videos:
Honors Project (Post Apocalypse Video Game) - Kotlin
QU Maps Presentation - Kotlin
