Hello. This is a GitHub for all of my projects in one place. I had a school GitHub for various projects, but I don't want it all to be lost when my Quincy email gets deleted.

This does not include any graphic design projects.

I have a fork of my senior capstone project that I am waiting for my group member who owns the repository to make public, so that is not on here, but is coming. It was written using python.

I have uploaded some videos of some of my projects to youtube @ https://www.youtube.com/@MaryHoette

Current Videos:
Honors Project (Post Apocalypse Video Game) - Kotlin
QU Maps Presentation - Kotlin
Animal Rush Video Game - C++ in Unity Game Engine
